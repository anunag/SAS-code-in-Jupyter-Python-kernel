# Using Jupyter notebook to run Python and SAS code example.
How to utilize Jupyter notebook to run SAS and Python code in one kernel (Python).
Mini project shows you how you can utilize python kernel to run python and SAS code and use the outputs interchangeably. 
You would see that "Data Exploration" and "Feature Engineering" part is done in python code. Data generated from those steps is utilized by SAS code (using magic command) to run "Logistic Regression" part in python kernel.

Titanic data is being used for this example. You would require to change the data/ path in your code in order to run.
